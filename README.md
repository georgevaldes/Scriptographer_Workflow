Scriptographer 3D Workflow tools
=====

Scripting within the realm of Architecture is all too often relegated to novel formal explorations. 
This repository is to catalog a series of tools that are meant for professionals and students to use in their everyday workflow 
between 3D software and Adobe Illustrator. While these tools are simple (for now) they are meant to facilitate mundane tasks
like turning off and restyling hidden layers and hopefully will build into much more task efficient tools.
